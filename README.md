## About
This is a calculator with basic commands to add, subtract, divide and multiply
To make the user experience more fluid, the “equals” button has been removed, so every time a new number is added, the calculation takes place automatically
## How to run
Basically, you just need to clone the repository and open the **index.html** file in your browser.
If you are using VSCode, you can also use the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
## To do
 - Delete only one number
 - Calculate percentage
 - Use the result in a new calculation
 - Calculation history
